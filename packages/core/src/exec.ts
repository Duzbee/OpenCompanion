 * without enabling a shell, keeping the no-interpolation guarantee. Resolves with the exit
 * code and captured stdout; never rejects (a non-zero exit, spawn error, or the 10s
 * timeout are all reported via a non-zero `code`). When `opts.maxStdoutChars` is set, stdout
 * is capped WHILE reading (the child is killed once the cap is reached), so a flooding
 * command cannot buffer unbounded output.

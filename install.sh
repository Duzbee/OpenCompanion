# OpenCompanion installer for macOS and Linux. One command, no npm:
#
#   curl -fsSL https://github.com/Duzbee/OpenCompanion/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh -s -- --url https://your-saas.example/api
#
# It downloads the self-contained OpenCompanion daemon (a vendored Node runtime + the bundled daemon)
# for your OS and architecture, verifies it against the release SHA256SUMS, installs it under
# ~/.opencompanion, links the `opencompanion` launcher onto your PATH, then runs `opencompanion setup` (pair +
# connect your CLIs + install the always-on service). Re-run any time to upgrade in place;
# uninstall with `opencompanion uninstall`.
#
# Nothing is baked in. The daemon is fetched from the GitHub release by default; point
# OPENCOMPANION_RELEASE_BASE at a mirror to fetch it elsewhere. No backend URL is embedded: pass
# `--url <backend>` (or set OPENCOMPANION_BACKEND_URL) to pair with your SaaS at setup time.

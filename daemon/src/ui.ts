 * The companion CLI's terminal UI, built on `@clack/prompts` + `picocolors` so it matches the look
 * of the main GenerateSaaS CLI (boxed intro/outro, a gutter for status lines, arrow-key selects,
 * spinners). Presentation lives here and in `cli.ts`; the core flows (`pair`/`connect`/`serve`) stay
 * UI-agnostic and just take a `write(line)` sink, so `line` below is what routes their output into
 * this style.

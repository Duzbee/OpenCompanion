 * Builds the connect runner - the serve-daemon's executor for backend `connect` instructions. Its
 * security posture is the reason it exists as a distinct layer:
 *
 * - RE-VALIDATION: the toolId is re-checked against the connectable allowlist here (defense in depth
 *   behind the backend's enqueue-time check), so an unknown tool is skipped + logged, never executed.
 * - LEDGER: a bounded insertion-ordered request-id ledger dedupes a redelivered instruction (a lost
 *   result post + a queue redelivery), so a double-clicked or replayed connect runs at most once.
 * - SERIALIZATION: per-tool promise chaining serializes two live instructions for the SAME tool (the
 *   replace-then-redeliver double-click race) while different tools run concurrently.
 * - OFF THE POLL LOOP: {@link ConnectRunner.handle} is fire-and-forget, so a slow install/probe never
 *   blocks the poll cycle.
 * - NEVER INTERACTIVE: it drives {@link connectHeadless}, which never spawns a login or any process -
 *   a signed-out CLI reports `needs-login` and the user completes login in a terminal.
 *
 * A FAILED result post un-ledgers the request id so the still-queued instruction re-executes and
 * re-posts on redelivery (the result, not just the work, must land).
 *
 * @param deps - The registry, base dir, state reader, backend url, result poster, and connections reader.
 * @returns The connect runner.

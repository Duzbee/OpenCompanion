 * file mocks `node:fs` `existsSync` to ALWAYS report the key file absent - exactly the TOCTOU window
 * where two concurrent boots both "see" no key. A check-then-write path would then clobber the key a
 * concurrent boot already wrote (making its encrypted secrets undecryptable); the exclusive `wx`
 * create instead throws `EEXIST` on the existing file and reads the winner's key back. Isolated in
 * its own file because the mock would otherwise trip the sibling suite's real `existsSync`/`statSync`.
